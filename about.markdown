# Dan Rus Ciuca

I am 40 years old and I work as a **pathologist** in Karlstad. I come from **Cluj-Napoca**, a large city in the infamous region from Romania called **Transylvania**. It is of course known to all because of more or less ridiculous movies and stories about vampyres and Dracula.

I moved to Sweden with my wife in 2013 and to Karlstad in 2015. We don't have any children and we now live together with my old crazy cat in Forshaga, a little town / village north from Karlstad.

A few years ago I thought about reviving my interest in computers and programing which started a long time ago with Basic and Pascal (MS-DOS times!). I read some books and took online courses and web programing looked pretty interesting. It began as a hobby but it became much more serious, even as a possible new career path for me, especially now since I'm not very pleased with the lab in Karlstad.
