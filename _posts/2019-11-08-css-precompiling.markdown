I must admit I enjoyed writing the styles for this website using a CSS preprocessor, in this case SASS.

It has a lot of advantages like:
- shorter code 
- code that can be structured in a similar manner as a programming language (due to nesting) 
- less repetition
- the possibility of using variables, mixins (a type of functions), conditional expressions and even "for" loops!!
- performing calculations

I used most of these basic but useful techniques in my website: variables, nesting and mixins.

The biggest disadvantage in my opinion is the extra setup required in your project in order to generate the CSS files. Some developers think CSS preprocessors can help them write better styles but SASS cannot do that if you don't already have a solid CSS knowledge.
