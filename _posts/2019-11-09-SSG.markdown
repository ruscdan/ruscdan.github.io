A static site generator (SSG) is an easy-to-use versatile tool that enables you to create a static website with only HTML, text content and templates. As opposed to a Content Management System (CMS), an SSG generates all the pages once when there are changes to the site. Caching is easier, with higher performance and security.

If your project is a simple website for a blog, a CV, marketing a product or documenting a software then an SSG is your best choice!
